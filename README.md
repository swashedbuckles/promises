# tdd-promises-impl

A (eventually) [Promises/A+ compliant](https://promisesaplus.com/) implementation of Promises, wrapped up in a fun learning exercise.

1. Use TDD
2. Learn ava.js
3. Try not to cheat with other Promise implementations
4. Have fun.

Yay.

## Todo

* [ ] improve tests and test cases. consider [compliance test suite](https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-tests) for inspiration
* [ ] run implementation against compliance test suite
* [ ] refactor implementation; especially the then stuff and initial promise constructor.
